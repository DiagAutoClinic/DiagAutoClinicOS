# 🛡️ Security Architecture

## Core Security Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum permissions required for functionality
- **Zero Trust**: Verify explicitly, never trust always
- **Secure by Default**: Security features enabled by default

# 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

## Private Disclosure Process
We strongly prefer responsible disclosure through private channels:

**Preferred Method**: Email security@autodiag-suite.com
**Backup Method**: Use GitHub Security Advisories

## What to Include in Reports
- **Vulnerability Description**: Detailed explanation of the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential security impact
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are vulnerable
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have remediation suggestions

## Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage Completion**: Within 7 business days
- **Patch Development**: 30-90 days based on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: 90 days after patch availability

# 🔐 Security Features

## Authentication & Authorization
```python
# Multi-level security clearance
SecurityLevel = Enum('BASIC', 'TECHNICIAN', 'DEALER', 'MANUFACTURER')
UserRole = Enum('VIEWER', 'TECHNICIAN', 'ADMIN', 'AUDITOR')
```

## Secure Communication

· Session Management: Secure token-based sessions
· Input Validation: Comprehensive sanitization
· Port Security: Strict port validation patterns
· Protocol Security: Validated OBD-II protocol handling

## Data Protection

· Sensitive Data Masking: Automatic masking of serial numbers, VINs
· Secure Logging: No sensitive data in logs
· Memory Management: Secure cleanup of sensitive data

# 🛠️ Security Configuration

## Required Security Settings

```python
# In config.py
SECURITY_CONFIG = {
    "session_timeout": 3600,  # 1 hour
    "max_login_attempts": 3,
    "password_min_length": 12,
    "require_mfa": True,
    "audit_log_retention": 90,  # days
}
```

## Device Security

```python
# Safe port patterns only
SAFE_PORT_PATTERNS = [
    r'^/dev/ttyUSB[0-9]+$',
    r'^/dev/ttyACM[0-9]+$', 
    r'^COM[1-9][0-9]*$'
]
```
