## Cost Assumptions & Rationale

### **Labor Rate Adjustments**
- **Standard Rate:** $100/hour for experienced developer
- **Project Adjustment:** 25% discount for focused scope (basic immobilizer functions only)
- **Actual Rate:** $75/hour effective rate
- **Justification:** Simplified scope eliminates complex key programming hardware integration

### **Hardware Cost Optimization**
- **No Professional Tools:** Avoided $1,200-1,800 Autel IM608 costs
- **Standard VCIs:** $100-250 range sufficient for immobilizer functions
- **Test Vehicle:** Rental/loan instead of purchase ($500 vs $5,000+)

### **Timeline Efficiency**
- **8 Weeks Total:** Focused scope allows completion without extensions
- **No Parallel Development:** Single developer focus on core functionality
- **Existing Infrastructure:** Leverages DiagAutoClinicOS framework

## Budget Risk Mitigation

### **Cost Overrun Prevention**
1. **Fixed Scope:** Basic immobilizer functions only - no feature creep
2. **Weekly Reviews:** Budget vs. actuals tracking each week
3. **Contingency Fund:** $500 buffer for unexpected issues
4. **Phase Gates:** No advancement without budget approval

### **Cost Saving Opportunities**
1. **Open Source Tools:** Use free alternatives where possible
2. **Existing Assets:** Leverage DiagAutoClinicOS shared components
3. **Minimal Marketing:** Focus on organic user acquisition initially
4. **Efficient Testing:** Use mock data for most development phases
