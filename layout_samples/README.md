# DACOS AutoDiag Suite - Layout Concepts

This folder contains three fundamentally different UI layout architectures for the DACOS AutoDiag Suite, designed for professional industrial/automotive diagnostics.

## 1. The Kinetic Schematic Workspace (`01_mechanical_first.md`)
*   **Theme**: Mechanical-First / Digital Twin
*   **Core Concept**: A spatial, schematic-based interface where the user navigates the physical vehicle system.
*   **Best For**: Complex mechanical diagnosis, wiring troubleshooting, understanding system relationships.

## 2. The Command Center Interface (`02_automotive_command.md`)
*   **Theme**: Automotive Diagnostic Command / Flight Deck
*   **Core Concept**: A high-speed, state-aware interface optimized for situational awareness and rapid execution.
*   **Best For**: Routine service, fast scanning, bi-directional control, test drives.

## 3. The Industrial Logic Interface (`03_industrial_systems.md`)
*   **Theme**: Industrial Systems / SCADA
*   **Core Concept**: A hierarchical, signal-flow interface emphasizing traceability, logic debugging, and raw data visibility.
*   **Best For**: Deep ECU development, network debugging, complex sensor correlation, calibration.
